  My OSCP journey from Noob to Pro
</h1>

So it all starts when I graduated last year in 2016 and finiding my way to get a job in Infosec domain,before graduation I already have a CEH certification,But as you know it's so hard to get a job as a fresher in this domain specially in India untill you have some skills or have a reference. After getting rejected by almost 15 companies I decided to start increasing my skill, and there is no better way then OSCP. So on the 31st Dec night I talked to my father that I want to spend 1 year on OSCP and give me time to prove myself and I can't do job for now, after some discussion he eventually agreed. but the condition was I have to complete everything within the timelimit.

So on the 1st Jan my journey start, as I was totall noob at that time i only new how to run Nmap,Nessus,Nexpose and doing Vulnerabilty assessment report, and some sort of Wifi hacking, that it nothing more than that not even MSF ðŸ˜‚

So it took me 2 months to figure out where to start because there was no one to guide me at that time, So before I realise the sand is slipping from hands the month of march has reached, Then i downloaded the OSCP syllabus and googled about some OSCP realted VMs from [Vulnhub](http://www.abatchy.com/2017/02/oscp-like-vulnhub-vms), did few from them and like kioptix seriense and IMF and Brainpan to learn BOF, If you are new to BUffere overflow I recomend to start with [brainpan 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/brainpan-1,51/), I had a slow hand at that time so it took me 2 more months to complete these machine, In MAY I got to know about Hack The Box[(HTB)](https://www.hackthebox.eu), If you really want to do OSCP I wholeheartedly recommend you to buy the HTB Vip pack and finish all the retired machine before you start your lab. So, After finishing 2-3 simple machine in the start I start getting stuck, See when you are learning new stufs which you are not aware off and even you have all the resource avilable, it is hard to understand some stuffs by your self and at that time you need someone to guide you / mentor you which is hard to find, because most of the people don't care to share there knowledge with anyone, but I was lucky I met my mentor _**KNX**_. I am very thankfull to him to teach me soo many new things.

After completing all the machines in **HTB** I started my OSCP lab on 1st oct and in the start i was unfamiliar with the environment so it took me few days to get pace, I took the 2 months lab and within 40 days I completed all the machine on all 4 networks, and I would recommend to complete the videos course and lab exrecise before you start carcking lab machines.

**Overview on OSCP lab**
* In the lab always try to restrict yourself using MSFconsole because it's good to learn the manual way, but there are few machine on which you have to use msf and there is no public eploit availabe and this is because PWK want you to learn not only the manuall way but also the msf way.
* Don't think too much, or above the ground, try the simple default loggin first before you start some bruteforcing, you need to _**Try Smater**_ before you _**Try Harder**_.
